				<h3>Every Little Step by Bobby Brown&copy;</h3>
					<p>
						I can't <span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">sleep</span> at night, I toss and turn, <br>
						Listening for the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">telephone</span><br>
						But when I get your call, I'm all choked up<br>
						Can't believe you called my home<br>
						And as a matter of fact, it blows my mind<br>
						You wouldn't even talk to me<br>
						Because a girl like you is a dream come true<br>
						<em>A real life fantasy</em> <br>
